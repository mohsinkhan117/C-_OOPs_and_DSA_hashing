    list is doubly link list where front operations can be very easy and cheap
    rather than vectors and arrays. In vector insert operation can take a lot of time

   Key Characteristics
   Header: To use a list, you must include the <list> header file.
   Memory: Elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations.
   Access: Direct access to elements by index (e.g., list[0]) is not possible. Traversal must be done sequentially using iterators. The first and last elements can be accessed directly using front() and back() functions.
   Efficiency: Insertion and deletion operations anywhere in the list are highly efficient (constant time, O(1)) because only the pointers of the neighboring elements need to be updated.
   Pointers: Each element (node) contains a value, a pointer to the next element, and a pointer to the previous element, enabling bidirectional traversal.
